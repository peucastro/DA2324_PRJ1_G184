 This project is a part of the Design of Algorithms course (DA) in Spring 2024.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
The Water Supply Management Analysis Tool is developed to assist the Management Team of a water supply network in Portugal in making informed decisions about resource allocation. The tool allows for the analysis of network metrics, evaluation of network resilience, and identification of potential improvements.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Problem Statement}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The project aims to implement an analysis tool that supports the Management Team of a water supply network in making informed decisions about resource allocation, including financial and physical resources such as pumping stations and pipelines. The tool should allow management to allocate pumping stations to supply sources effectively, identify sensitive network sections, and mitigate service disruptions.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Running}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
To run the Water Supply Management Analysis Tool, please follow these steps\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}
\DoxyCodeLine{./DA2324\_PRJ1\_G184}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
The tool provides the following functionalities\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Calculation of maximum flow reaching each city in the network.
\item Evaluation of water deficit or excess for each city.
\item Analysis of the impact of reservoir, pumping station, and pipeline failures on network reliability.
\item Balancing the load across the network to minimize flow differences.
